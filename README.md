# @autumnblaze/bot-framework

Personal framework for discord bots, using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

I found that I'm duplicating code across the bots that I am writing, and I feel weird about this, so I made this to centralize all the code for those so I don't have to copy/paste everything everywhere. Plus, this could be useful to someone lol!

I don't want to use other frameworks because the main limitation to those were no clear way to do server-by-server custom prefixes. ~~plus they weren't mine and i wanted to write my own~~

## changelog

### v0.1.0

- initial setup everything, does nothing different from discord.js right now (except h function)
