# @autumnblaze/bot-framework

Personal framework for discord bots, using [discord.js][discordjs]

I found that I'm duplicating code across the bots that I am writing, and I feel weird about this, so I made this to centralize all the code for those so I don't have to copy/paste everything everywhere. Plus, this could be useful to someone lol!

I don't want to use other frameworks because the main limitation to those were no clear way to do server-by-server custom prefixes.

Find the documentation [here][masterdocs] (generated by [typedoc][typedoc])! Quickstart and other guides coming soon, when there is actual functionality that is different from discord.js.
